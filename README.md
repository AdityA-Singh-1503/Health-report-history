# HEALTH REPORT HISTORY
A Python command-line interface (CLI) application for calculating core health metrics-BMI, BMR, and TDEE and tracking progress over time using data visualization.

<h2>METRIC CALCULATION</h2>

Calculate three essential health metrics body mass index (BMI), basal matabolic rate (BMR), total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) based on your input like weight, height, age, gender and activity level.

1) Body mass index (BMI) : It calculates body fat based on person's height and weight.
2) Basal matabolic rate (BMR) : It is the minimumm number of calories required by your b0ody to function properly.
3) Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) : it is the total number of calories a person burns to maintain his/her weight.

<h2>DATA PERSISTENCE</h2>
Every entery (weight, height, age, BMI, BMR, TDEE) is stored in the file named health_history.csv.

<h2>REAL TIME VISUALIZATION</h2>
Uses matplotlib to generate and display 2 graphs which show

1) A bar chart of this session's BMI
